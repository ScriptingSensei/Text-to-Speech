# Text-to-Speech

This project is a fully functional Text-to-Speech (TTS) application built using Python, designed to convert written text into audible speech. The application is developed with a focus on simplicity and user experience, utilizing the `tkinter` library to create an intuitive graphical user interface (GUI) that allows seamless interaction for users with minimal technical knowledge.

Key features of the application include:

- **Text Input and File Handling**: Users can manually enter text or upload files (e.g., .txt) using the file dialog functionality from `tkinter`. The uploaded content is then converted into speech.
  
- **Speech Synthesis**: The core of the TTS functionality is powered by the `pyttsx3` library, which offers offline speech synthesis. This module supports multiple voices, allowing users to choose between different male or female voices for the text-to-speech conversion. 

- **Voice Customization**: Users can adjust various voice parameters such as speech rate and volume, giving them full control over how the text is read aloud. This allows for tailored speech output, from fast and clear to slow and deliberate.

- **Interactive GUI**: The GUI is designed to be straightforward, providing dropdown menus and buttons for voice selection, starting or stopping speech playback, and adjusting settings. The use of the `tkinter.ttk.Combobox` widget simplifies the selection of different voices and speech rates.

- **Modular and Scalable**: The project is designed to be modular, making it easy to extend with additional features, such as saving speech output as audio files (e.g., MP3 or WAV). It also opens possibilities for integration with other applications like accessibility tools or language learning platforms.

This project demonstrates proficiency in Python GUI development, text-to-speech technologies, and the practical application of libraries to create a tool that could be utilized for educational, accessibility, or entertainment purposes. It showcases skills in user interface design, handling user inputs, and enhancing Python-based applications with third-party modules.
